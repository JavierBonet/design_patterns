# Design patterns

## Description
This repository is intended to show, through examples, how the most popular design patters can be implemented in **Typescript**![](public/images/icons8-typescript-20.png).

## Structure
The same way this topic is structured in many posts out there, the examples in this repository are placed under three main folders:
- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral

In each one there is a specific folder for each design pattern which contains one or more examples for that pattern in particular.

## Links
One of the sources that the author used as a guidance can be found [here](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns).
